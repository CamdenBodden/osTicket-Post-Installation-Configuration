<h1>osTicket - Project</h1>





<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Computer)
- Remote Desktop
- osTicket Ticketing System

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11</b> 

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
I will be creating a virtual machine that has osTicket installed on it. I will demonstrate experience as both the administrator and user by creating, assigning, and resolving tickets. This project covers important aspects of ticketing systems such as:

- Tickets properties
- SLAs
- Departments
- Users
- Creating, assigning, and resolving tickets

<h2>Part 1 (Create Virtual Machine in Azure)</h2>

</p>
<h2>Part 2 (Remote Desktop into the VM and install osTicket)</h2>
I will be using the public IP address that azure assigned my virtual machine to remote desktop into the virtual machine.

</p>

<h2>Part 3 (Post Installation Setup)</h2>
As an admin I will be creating the departments, teams, and the support engineers accounts. Then I will be configuring the SLAs which defines the ticket severity and the metrics that agents will use to resolve tickets. I will also be configuring the help topics that clients can choose which will help categorize the tickets.

<h3>Configure Departments</h3>

</p>

<h2>Part 4 (Tickets and Ticket Lifecycle)</h2>
I will sign in as a hypothetical users and create some tickets that needs to be solved by IT support. I will then sign into the admin account and assign the tickets to each support agent. I will then demonstrate resolving a ticket as an IT support engineer.

<h3>Creating tickets as an user</h3>
